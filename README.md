NOTES I updated all old Discord API versions on request links. For the account connections (linked accounts) like YouTube, Steam, Github... I could not use get function because converting it in dictionary is very hard because Discord API give it as list of dictionaries and I tried to split them but it was to difficult. Apart from that I added to the token grabber victim's account biography as footer text. I also managed to get banner as gif / png in the embed, I found that it was almost the same as avatar link but it was /banners/userid/bannerid instead of /avatars/userid/avatarid. And finally for linked accounts I still put them in the token grabber but only deleting the characters of list and dictionary to make it look more understandable. Thanks you if you found some solutions, send it in the Github pull requests.Please do not use the program maliciously. This program is intended to be used for educational purposes only. Mercurial is only used to demonstrate what type of information attackers can grab from a user's computer. This is a project was created to make it easier for malware analysts or ordinary users to understand how credential grabbing works and can be used for analysis, research, reverse engineering, or review.

What is malware?

Malware is a term that is used for malicious software that is designed to do damage or unwanted actions to a computer system.
An explanation of this tool:

Google Chrome always store user data in the same place, so the stealer generated by Mercurial Grabber has no problem in finding it. In theory at least, this data is stored in encrypted form. However, if the malware has already penetrated the system, then its actions are done in your name.

Therefore, the malware simply finds a way to decrypt information stored on your computer (by making it seem like thie user is requesting it) . The stealer gets all your passwords and cookies.

The tool is also able to find Roblox cookies that are stored in the Windows Registry. By running the malicious .exe file, it is able to search for the Roblox cookie. The same goes for Minecraft sessions, Discord tokens, etc since it is stored in the user's computer.

Recommended tools for testing Mercurial: (when running the produced output after building)

Virtualbox
VMware
Process Hacker
VirusTotal
Tips to check if an exe file is safe:

Analyze the file with VirusTotal
Check if the exe file has a publisher
Check it in a sandbox
Monitor the file’s network activity for strange behavior
